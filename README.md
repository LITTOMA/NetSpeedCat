# What is this?
I really like the way NetSpeedMonitor displays the internet speed on the taskbar via Desk Band. Unfortunately, Microsoft removed the Desk Band feature in Windows 11 (well done, Microsoft!).

I tried to find various alternatives, but none of them met my needs. Until I realised, hey, I'm a software developer too, why not develop one myself? And that's how Net Speed Cat became true.

# Buy me a coffee
